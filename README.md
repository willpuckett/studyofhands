## Instructions

Print as many columns/thumbs as you plan to use in your board (col.stl & thumb.stl). 
Poplate them with 6x3mm round magnets, switches, and keycaps.

It's preferable to use the keycaps you plan on using on the final board.
Type on it for a bit, and push and shove till it feels real good.

Scan and scale your board in your favorite cad app (shapr3d works well), then import the col and thumb svgs from this project.

Move and rotate the svgs over the keys.
